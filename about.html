        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Kacper "Polish" Abramowski.</p><br>
        <p>I'm a self-taught programmer with a passion of creating software that solves problems no one has!<br>Allthough I'm currently looking for my first full-time job, I have spent countless hours developing &lt;<a href="projects.html">Personal Projects</a>&gt; that range from very simple software to small scale games!</p>
        <p>I have worked with multiple technologies such as Python, HTML, PHP and Lua to name a couple. I do have a &lt;<a href="https://www.Github.com/PolishDogge" target="_blank">Public GitHub</a>&gt;, on which you can find projects like:</p>
        <div class="exampleProjects">
            · <a href="https://github.com/PolishDogge/Twitch-Message-Counter">Twitch Message Counter:</a>
            <p>A program that keeps track of user sent messages in the chat of the streamer. It might be used for a 'loyalty' system or used for purely 'statistic keeping'. It was made using my own made library "Python Twitch OAuth" and mainly the requests library.</p>
            · <a href="https://github.com/PolishDogge/Spotify-Show-Currently-Playing"> Spotify Show Currently Playing</a>
            <p>The program that, as the name implies, the currently listened to track from Spotify and displays it in a box made from TkInter. With multiple settings, ways of configuring it and the code being rather simple. Uses the Spotify API, TkInter and PIL libraries. </p>
